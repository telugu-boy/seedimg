    Streaming API


        Through this API images can be sequentially encoded/decoded, from arbitrary
        output/input streams which eliminates the usage of file based reading.

        Arbitrary linear filters can be applied when performing I/O. State requring,
        non-linear filters are subject to potential UB.

        THIS API IS STILL IN ITS EXPERIMENTAL STAGE PLEASE DO NOT IMITATATE TO USE IT
        IN A PRODUCTION ENVIRONMENT. FINIALISATION OF THIS API WILL REQUIRE A SIGNFICANT
        AMOUNT OF TIME.

        However, for some image formats sequential I/O is not quite possible
        such as WebP, because RIFF requires either a seekable stream for updating
        the size of RIFF chunk at the end of writing the whole file or to buffer
        the whole bytestream in memory to write it all once its fully encoded.
